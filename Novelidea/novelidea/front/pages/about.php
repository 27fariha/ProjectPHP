	          <p>Open textbooks are textbooks that have been funded, published, and licensed to be used, adapted, and distributed. These books have been reviewed by faculty from a variety of colleges and universities to assess their quality. These books can be downloaded for some cost, or printed at low cost. All textbooks are either used at multiple higher education institutions; or affiliated with an institution, scholarly society, or professional organization. The library currently includes many textbooks, with more being added all the time.</p>

Pityful a rethoric question ran over her cheek, then she continued her way.</p>

	            <p>Thanks to the imagination of skilled authors, even books set in the real world can be filled with mysteries and intrigue. However, some authors are not content with simply creating characters, but prefer to also re-imagine the world's that they inhabit. We have in our library, some of the amazing universes conjured up by talented authors who were not afraid to dream big.</p>
